1/11 = 100 kg
1/1 = lighter or heavier

My take: 
3 groups of 4 people total of 12


Sample Scenario:
each letter symbolizes a man

x is the unique man, heavier
1st seesaw use:
	sample:
		qwer
		asdf
		zxcv	
	run: 
		qwer vs asdf = all equal weight
		unique man should be in group: zxcv
2nd seesaw use: 
	sample:
		zx
		cv
	run: 
		zx vs cv
		zx 
3rd seesaw use:
	sample:
		z
		x
	run: 
		x since earlier zx is heavier

but what if I pit qwer vs zxcv first?

1st seesaw use:
	sample:
		qwer
		asdf
		zxcv
	run: 
		qwer vs zxcv 
		unbalanced but where is the  unique man?
2nd seesaw use: 
	sample:
		qw vs er
		
	run: 
		
3rd seesaw use:
	sample:
		
	run: 
		x since earlier zx is heavier
Notes: 
If at the 1st seesaw the balance is already unequal, then swap out a pair 
from each group and put it in the other one.
Problem:
Twelve men are on a desert island, all with identical weights except for one of them, who is slightly lighter or heavier than the others.
The only other thing on the island is a seesaw.
There are no scales or means to measure weight otherwise.
Can you determine which man has the different weight?
You only get to use the seesaw three times.
